# PL4DS Meetings and Event Series

PL4DS is a a series of meetings and events around research on Programming Languages for Distributed Systems.

Programming languages for distributed systems have been flourishing in the past, providing ideas for the development of complex systems that have been deeply influential. However, over the last few years, researchers focusing on this area are scattered across different communities with limited interaction.

### What it was about

Developing distributed systems is a well-known, decades-old problem in Computer Science. Despite significant research effort has been dedicated to this area, developing distributed systems remains challenging. To complicate things, over the last years, we observed the rise of a complex scenario, with heterogeneous platforms, interconnected systems and decentralized functionalities. This model, referred to as edge computing, is driven – among others – by forces like the need of reducing latency in geodistributed services via multiple data centers, the advent of purpose- driven microservices, and the spreading of in-field decision intelligence in the Internet of Things.

Programming languages are a fundamental tool to face the complexity of such a scenario. In compar- ison, however, these have seen modest improvements. Arguably, many ideas for supporting distribution adopted in production languages date back to the early ’90s with CORBA/RMI, and even earlier with the Actor model [27, 24] and concurrent objects [26, 25, 23]. In contrast, language abstractions have been mostly a key asset for determining the popularity of dedicated systems. For example, MapReduce takes advantage of purity to parallelise task processing, complex event processing adopts declarative program- ming [13] to express sophisticated event correlations and Spark leverages functional programming for efficient fault recovery via lineage [16] – to provide some examples.

There have been, notable advances in research on programming languages for distributed systems, such as cloud types for eventual consistency [12], conflict-free replicated data types (CRDT) [17], lan- guage support for safe distribution of computations [9] and fault tolerance [3], as well as programming frameworks for mixed IoT/Cloud development, such as Ericsson’s Calvin [5] – just to mention a few. However, these efforts have seen limited adoption and the researchers that have been carrying out these efforts are scattered across different communities that include verification and formal methods in general, programming language design, database theory, distributed systems, systems programming, data-centric programming, and web application development.

In contrast, the field of programming languages for distributed systems has been a flourishing research area in the past, with influential contributions like Argus, Emerald, and Distributed OZ.
